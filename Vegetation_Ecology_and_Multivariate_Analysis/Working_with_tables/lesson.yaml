  Course: Vegetation Ecology and Multivariate Analysis
  Lesson: Working with tables
  Author: Friedemann von Lampe, based on courses by RLab Team 
  Type: Standard
  Organization: Georg-August-University Göttingen
  Version: 2.4.5
  
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Welcome to the second lesson in which you learn how to load data tables into R. At this point of course we recommend that you have created your own RStudio project for our course as well as downloaded and extracted all data-files into the subfolder 'data' of your project-folder. If you haven't done this yet, you can still carry out this lesson, as long as you have access to the agroforestry dataset. If you have any questions or problems, please ask the tutors!"

- Class: text
  Output: 'If you want to cancel a course, you can type "bye()" or press the escape key. If one of these functions does not work, try the other variant. This way you end the package "swirl", to start "swirl" again, start again with the input of swirl().'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'When an RStudio project is loaded, the project  directory is automatically set as the "working directory". 
    To see which file path this is, and if it is correct, you can let R execute the function "getwd()". 
    Try it out right away and type or copy the command "getwd()" into the console and press "Enter"'
  CorrectAnswer: getwd()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='getwd()')
  Hint: 'Type or copy the command "getwd()" into your console and press the "Enter" key.'
  

- Class: text
  Output: 'Very nice. With the command setwd() you can (re-)define your working directory. To avoid absolute pathnames we will not use the setwd()-command in each script but use our RStudio project folder instead. This is the folder, you justed displayed with getwd(). You can also see it in RStudio at the top of the Console-window. Now we can import data into our workspace. Unfortunately, it is easy to make mistakes when loading data - so you can practise it here step by step!'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'R is compatible with different file formats. You can read in text files (.txt), Excel tables (.xls, .xlsx) and CSV files (.csv). The agroforest dataset (a sample dataset from an agroforestry study in Kaule, Nepal) used in this lesson is stored in two of these formats. For importing in R the CSV-format is a really good choice, as it works really easy and exact'

- Class: exact_question
  Output: First look at the agroforest dataset as a CSV file. You should find the file agroforest_var.csv in the /data/raw subfolder of your project folder. Open the file with Microsoft Excel/LibreOffice Calc. How many rows are in the data?
  CorrectAnswer: 120
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 120)
  Hint: "Scroll to the last row in the file. Rows scroll down, columns scroll to the right."

- Class: text_question
  Output: Do the columns have headings? Yes or no? 
  CorrectAnswer: 'yes'
  AnswerTests: val_matches('[Y|y]es')
  Hint: Look at the beginning of the table. Type yes or no. 

- Class: text
  Output: Column headings are called "header" in R. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For loading tables into R the read.table function is used. Of course, there are other possibilities, such as read.csv(). But the read.table() function is the least likely to cause errors. Please call the help page for "read.table" from the Console. Do you remember the command?
  CorrectAnswer: ?read.table
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('?read.table', 'help(read.table)')
  Hint: Type ?read.table and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Looking at the help window for read.table() a list of function arguments appears under "Usage". You need to specify these inside the function to correctly read a file. All of them are useful, but we will limit ourselves to the most important ones. The detailed explanations of the arguments is found further down in section "Arguments" of the help page.

- Class: text
  Output: The easiest way for errors to occur when reading in is through no or incorrect information about the structure of the file. It is especially important to specify decimal and column separators, as these often differ. These can be spaces, points or commas.

- Class: text
  Output: In Germany, the comma is normally used as the decimal separator and the space bar as the column separator. 

- Class: text_question
  Output: However, if you look at the CSV (Comma-Separated-Value) file again, what decimal separator is used here? You can just type in the character. As Excel sometimes performs weird data transformations of CSV-files automatical, it may be helpful to open the file in the simple Windows Editor (right-klick in Explorer, then "Open with - Editor").
  CorrectAnswer: '.'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = '.')
  Hint: Indicates either a "," or a ".". Quotes are not necessary. 

- Class: text
  Output: 'Great! Now we still have to find out which column separator is used here. In Excel/Calc this is done by the table lines, but what is it really like?  To be able to define the column separators correctly, you should first open the file in the Editor. To do this, simply right-click on the file and select "Open with - Editor"'

- Class: mult_question
  Output: By which character are the individual values separated?
  CorrectAnswer: 'comma'
  AnswerChoices: "semicolon; comma; point"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='comma')
  Hint: Look again in the editor. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now you know which decimal and column separators are used. Which arguments do you think are used to define them?
  CorrectAnswer: sep und dec
  AnswerChoices: "sep und dec; header; quote"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='sep und dec')
  Hint: column separators are called "separators".

- Class: text
  Output: Done! So, as decimal separator for this file we specify dec="." and as column separator sep=";".

- Class: text_question
  Output: 'Earlier you found out that there are column headers in the file to be read. In the help you see that information about the header can be given. header= "TRUE" or header= "FALSE" - Which argument do you have to give? TRUE or FALSE?'
  CorrectAnswer: 'TRUE'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'TRUE')
  Hint: "type TRUE or FALSE"
  
- Class: text
  Output: First of all, you must specify the storage location where the file is located. Usually you do this with the argument file= "drive/folder/file". As we have defined our project directory as working directory, we only have to define the relative position of the file to the base folder of our working directory. So it you copied the CSV file into the "data/raw"-subfolder this will be "data/raw/file". That is really practical, as it is the same on all computers running this project - you can just copy the folder on your USB-stick or share it in the cloud, it will always work!

- Class: text
  Output: Now you have all the information you need to read in.
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'So the function to read in the agroforestry data file could look like this: read.table(file = "/data/raw/agroforest_var.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", dec = ".")'
  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'In the next step, please load the CSV file into your console. You use the function read.table() for this. To make this course work, we avoid typing the real directory here. Instead simply use "agroforest_path" (works only here in this swirl-course). Type read.table(agroforest_path, header = TRUE, sep = "," ,dec = ".") or copy it directly. Then press "Enter" and load the file into your console.'
  CorrectAnswer: read.table(agroforest_path, header = TRUE, sep = ",", dec = ".")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'read.table(agroforest_path, header = TRUE, sep = ",", dec = ".")')
  Hint: 'Use the function read.table(agroforest_path, header = TRUE, sep = "," ,dec = "."). The data should appear in your Console'

- Class: text
  Output: In the console, above this text, you should have seen the table that was read in, which looks like a jumble of numbers. Of course, you don't just want to look at it, you also want to use it. 

- Class: text
  Output: 'With an assignment arrow "<-" you can assign the data to a self-selected object name. This way, the file becomes a usable variable in the programme. As you may remember, in R this is called an "object".'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'You can now type af <- read.table(agroforest_path, header = TRUE, sep = ",", dec = ".") into the console or copy the function and press "Enter". This way you assign the object name "af" to the file! Please ignore the warning messsage.'
  CorrectAnswer: af <- read.table(agroforest_path, header = TRUE, sep = ",", dec = ".")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'af <- read.table(agroforest_path, header = TRUE, sep = ",", dec = ".")')
  Hint: 'You use an assignment arrow and the read.table function. af <- read.table(agroforest_path, header = TRUE, sep = ",", dec = ".")'
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Where does the data from the CSV file appear now?
  CorrectAnswer: Global Environment
  AnswerChoices: Global Environment; R-Script; Console
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Global Environment')
  Hint: A new object should have appeared in the RStudio window, top right. What is the name of this area? Global Environment or History?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Super! By reading in the data you have mastered one big hurdle in working with R. There are specific variants of the read.table-function, such as read.csv/read.csv2. You can find their specifications in the Help of read.table. Let's check them out. Call the help for read.table."
  CorrectAnswer: ?read.table
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('?read.table', '?read.table()', 'help(read.table)')
  Hint: 'You can call up the help using ? We are looking for help on the function "read.table". The correct input is as follows: ?read.table. Type or copy this into the console and then send your input to R with the "Enter" key.'
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Scroll down in the Usage section to the function 'read.csv2'. For each function you find a list of arguments with their default values. Default values are used, when no other specification is given by the user. Explanations of the arguments are found in section Arguments further down. Which field separator character is used by default in 'read.csv2'?"
  CorrectAnswer: 'semicolon'
  AnswerChoices: "semicolon; comma; point"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='semicolon')
  Hint: "Look again on the help page. The field separator character is defined by the argument 'sep'."
  
- Class: text
  Output: Very nice. 'read.csv2' can be used for various European locales, where the comma character serves as the decimal point. Sometimes these functions can shorten the code for loading a dataset a little bit, if you know the specifications of your CSV-file. However, you should know the basic read.table-function and how to check the separators and decimals of a CSV, as there are no universal rules!'
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now we should check if everything is loaded correctly and get some informations about the dataset
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'In RStudio you can simply view the dataset by clicking on in in the Environment (it does the same as typing View(af) in the Console). Just try it out'
  CorrectAnswer: View(af)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = View(af))
  Hint: The first letter must be capitalised. Do not use spaces.

- Class: text
  Output: A new tab-window should have opened. You can look at the table and even sort the columns. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The table is quite extensive and the view in the "View-Tab" may be somewhat confusing. You can also check the first rows of the data in the console by displaying the beginning of the table with head(). Try to aply the function on the dataset. 
  CorrectAnswer: head(af)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('head(af)')
  Hint: Type head(af). 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: With R you can also display the number of rows and columns. With the code nrow(af), the programme gives you the number of rows. Let R show you the number of rows.
  CorrectAnswer: nrow(af)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('nrow(af)')
  Hint: Use the function nrow(af). 
  
- Class: exact_question
  Output: How many lines are there?
  CorrectAnswer: 119
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 119)
  Hint: Enter the command nrow(af) and press "enter". Now the number of lines is given. Type the correct number.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The same is possible with the number of columns. What could the command be?
  CorrectAnswer: ncol
  AnswerChoices: ncol; columns; colno
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='ncol')
  Hint: Look at the function for displaying the rows. 

- Class: exact_question
  Output: Now display the number of columns in the af data set.
  CorrectAnswer: ncol(af)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = ncol(af))
  Hint: Use the function ncol(af).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: It is also possible to query both values at the same time. This gives you the "dimensions" of the table. Enter dim(af) for this. 
  CorrectAnswer: dim(af)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('dim(af)')
  Hint: Make sure that the brackets are closed. Do not use spaces.
  
- Class: text
  Output: You'll see only two values are given and no "label". Check what is displayed first - rows or columns? You can also see that both dimensions are also given in the Environment window of RStudio. According to the rules for scientific tables the rows are "observations" and the columns are "variables". However, it is still useful to know the functions, as you may need them for some calculations in R.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If you look at the table "af", you will see that the columns have headings. With names(af) you can display all the column headings without having to switch from the console to the other window. Why don't you try out the function right now? 
  CorrectAnswer: names(af)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('names(af)')
  Hint: Enters names(af). The headings now appear in the console.


- Class: text
  Output: Especially with such an extensive table, displaying individual values and saving them is very important in order to work with them in R. Individual values from a table can be selected by specifying the numbers of the corresponding row and column. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let R output a value from the af data. You can simply type or copy af[10, 5]. 
  CorrectAnswer: af[10, 5]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'af[10, 5]')
  Hint: Enter af[10, 5].
  
- Class: exact_question
  Output: What value appears in the console?
  CorrectAnswer: 190
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 190)
  Hint: Scroll up a little in the console, there you will find the result just given.
 
- Class: mult_question 
  Output: So what is indicated first in the square brackets?
  CorrectAnswer: "rows"
  AnswerChoices: rows; columns 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='rows')
  Hint: 'Scroll up a little in the console. There you can see the answer in the previous queries. Otherwise, take another look at the table and read the rows/columns. In which row do you find the number 190 and where in the square brackets is this row number?'
  
- Class: exact_question
  Output: With the help of the square brackets, you can also load individual values into the global environment and assign them to an object. You choose a name for the new object and use the arrow to assign it as usual. For example, load the value just called as an object with the name x into the Global Environment. You can type or copy x <- af[10, 5] into the console. The value 190 should now appear as variable x in the global environment.
  CorrectAnswer: x <- af[10, 5]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = x <- af[10, 5])
  Hint: Enter x <- af[10, 5]. The value 190 should now appear as variable x in the Global Environment.
  
- Class: mult_question 
  Output: 'In this way you can also load individual data series into the global environment. To do this, you choose a new object name, for example the column heading, and use the arrow as an assignment as usual. How do you extract rows 1 to 119 from column 10? A colon means "to".'
  CorrectAnswer: "total_cov <- af[1:119, 10]"
  AnswerChoices: "total_cov <- af[1:119, 10]; total_cov <- af[1, 10]" 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='total_cov <- af[1:119, 10]')
  Hint: The colon symbolises a "to".
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Earlier you used several functions (dim(), nrow()...) to get an overview of the data set. A summary of all this is offered by the function str(), with which you can display the "structure" of the data. Try it out right away and enter the function str(af). 
  CorrectAnswer: str(af)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('str(af)')
  Hint: Enter str(af). 
  
- Class: mult_question 
  Output: "In the console, above this text, a table appears. At the very beginning of the table, it is stated that it is a dataframe that contains 119 rows (observations) and 19 columns (variables). But what is hidden in the rows below, behind the dollar signs?"
  CorrectAnswer: Column names
  AnswerChoices: Column names; Row names 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Column names')
  Hint: Look at the data set again. Columns run from left to right, rows down.

- Class: text
  Output: "R recognises the data types and lists it in abbreviated form after the individual column headings. For example: 'int' (integer), 'num' (numeric), 'chr' (character). Remember the last lesson, when you created vectors of these different data types. Here we have another object type, which is called a data frame. A data frame is a combination of multiple vectors, each of exactly the same length - so what we usually call a table. Missing values in a data frame will be denoted as 'NA'."

- Class: mult_question 
  Output: What object type represents each columns of our dataframe?
  CorrectAnswer: vector
  AnswerChoices: vector; line; list
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='vector')
  Hint: You can think of every column as a single vector of the displayed data type.


- Class: text
  Output: "Exactly! Each column of a dataframe is a single vector (with a specific data type). These   dollar signs are really helpful to select single variables of a dataframe. E.g. you want to select the variable 'altit' (which stands for altitude) from the data set. To do this, you must first create a reference to the data set, which is done quite simply by entering 'af'. If you type a dollar sign behind it, all column names will already be displayed (if not, press the Tab key). Selecting the variable in this way avoids some typing errors."


- Class: mult_question
  Output: That was a lot of information at once. Can you imagine what the function must look like?
  AnswerChoices: af$altit;$altit;altit$af
  CorrectAnswer: af$altit
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='af$altit')
  Hint: You can scroll up in the console and read the previous descriptions again. Which function fits best?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "First try the dollar sign function. Type af and the dollar sign. Then select the variable altit and press Enter."
  CorrectAnswer: af$altit
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='af$altit')
  Hint: You can simply copy or type $altit.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "What is displayed now in the Console is the content of the variable 'altit' as numeric vector, which is in column 4 of our dataframe. Thinking about what you learned earlier about selecting data from a data frame, how could you perform the same selection using the square brackets []?"
  AnswerChoices: af[1:119, 4]; af[4, 1:119]; af[4]
  CorrectAnswer: af[1:119, 4]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='af[1:119, 4]')
  Hint: You can scroll up in the console and read the previous descriptions again. At which position in the brackets are rows and columns?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "If you want to select all rows of one column, you can also simply leave this side of the comma empty. af[1:119, 4] does exactly the same as af[, 4] (the same is possible vice versa for selecting all columns of one row). We will need this often, so to repeat this again: Try to select all rows of the columns 5 to 7 and save the result into a new object called 'aspect'"
  CorrectAnswer: aspect <- af[, 5:7]
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('aspect <- af[, 5:7]', 'aspect <- af[1:119, 5:7]', 'aspect <- af[, c(5,6,7)]')
  Hint: Enter aspect <- af[, 5:7] in the console to select all rows of columns 5 to 7 (indicated by the colon).
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Nice. Now look at your Environment. Have a short look at the table by opening it from the Environment."    
  CorrectAnswer: View(af)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = View(af))
  Hint: Click on the data frame in the Environment or type View(af). The first letter must be capitalised. Do not use spaces.
  
- Class: text
  Output: You just created a new data frame containing only these three selected variables. This way you can easily subset your data if necessary.  

- Class: mult_question 
  Output: There is another specific data type for nominal variables in R, which is called "factor". This is very practical for further analyses as you can group the data set this way and analyses will interpret the variable correctly. Which of the variables in the dataset should be interpreted as "factor"? 
  CorrectAnswer: fama
  AnswerChoices: fama; area_nr; total_cov; altit
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='fama')
  Hint: Take another close look at the variables. Which one is a nominal variable, i.e. contains categories. If you cannot tell from the table, look in the metadata-sheet of the agroforest.xls Excel-table in your data folder. 
 
- Class: text
  Output: "You are right! The 'fama'-Variable seems to contain different categories represented by letters. If you open the agroforest.xls Excel-table and look in the metadata-sheet, you'll see that the letters represent different types of farm management. The 'area_nr' is also a character vector, but contains a unique plot ID instead of categories. In general a factor (= nominal/categorial variable) can be any data type, as long as it represents categories. E.g. the three types of farm management could as well be numbered '1', '2' and '3' and still be a factor. But how does R know which variable is a factor? We need to tell the programme!"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "To assign the data type 'factor' to a variable, you can use the function as.factor(). Type as.factor(af$fama)"
  CorrectAnswer: as.factor(af$fama)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'as.factor(af$fama)')
  Hint: Enter as.factor(af$fama).
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now you defined the variable 'fama' as factor. But we should change the assignment in the data frame for having it ready for further analyses. You can do this by overwriting the variable inside the dataframe using the assignment arrow. Type af$fama <- as.factor(af$fama)." 
  CorrectAnswer: af$fama <- as.factor(af$fama)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'af$fama <- as.factor(af$fama)')
  Hint: Type af$fama <- as.factor(af$fama).
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, lets check the structure of the data frame again. Use the function you've learned earlier."
  CorrectAnswer: str(af)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('str(af)')
  Hint: Enter str(af). 
  
- Class: mult_question 
  Output: The different categories of a factor are called levels. In which factor levels is $fama divided into? Look at the structure.
  CorrectAnswer: ABC
  AnswerChoices: ABC; 123
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='ABC')
  Hint: Take another close look at the structure. The numbers are only representatives of the factor levels, which are given in quoted. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Another really useful function to get an overview of your data is the summary()-function. This is already a step into descriptive statistics, but we will try it right now. Apply the function on the data frame"
  CorrectAnswer: summary(af)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('summary(af)')
  Hint: Enter summary(af). 

- Class: exact_question
  Output: "You see that you get a summary statistics for each variable. For numerical variables this is e.g. the mean, median, min or max values. For categorial variables (factors) you get the number of observations per factor level. How many observations were done in category 'C' of variable 'fama'?"  
  CorrectAnswer: 39
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 39)
  Hint: Have a closer look on the variable fama. You can see the numbers of observations per factor level there. 

  
- Class: text
  Output: "It is always important to get an idea of the data series before you calculate with them. After reading a file into R, you can display some information with the functions str(), head() and summary(). You can get into the habit of always executing these functions first after reading in data to check whether the reading worked correctly. In addition, you can also display the entire table by opening the View()-tab via the Environment."

- Class: text
  Output: Congratulations - you have successfully completed this lesson! In the last section, you already dipped a little into the first statistics content. For subsetting data selections using logical conditions are really useful. You can practise that in the next lesson.
